<p>This is a great example blog entry. You have to use the markdown syntax here. So you can make text <strong>bold</strong> or <em>italic</em>. Whatever you want. You can also add</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A qoute or a block qoute.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://via.placeholder.com/350x150" alt="It is also possible to add pictures!" />
<p class="caption">It is also possible to add pictures!</p>
</div>
<p>But whatever you do: Do <strong>NOT</strong> forget to compile this text using the compile script, included in the download!</p>
<p>Happy writing!</p>
